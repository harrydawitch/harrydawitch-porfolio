    So I started asking people I knew, if they were facing any challenges in their work?

    It turned out that one of my high-school friends, who is majoring in architecture, came and said to me that...
    He was tired of paying for expensive AI architecture tools through monthly subscriptions on the internet...

    He asked if I could build a similar thing. If I could, he‚Äôd market my work to other students who also struggle financially.

    At that moment, I was honestly scared to accept the challenge. I had no idea where to start.
    But like I said, I love solving problems. So from that very night, I jumped straight into this project.
